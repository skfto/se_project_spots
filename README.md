**Intro**
  
This project features a fully resposive and interchangeable interface, designed to deliver a seamless user experience across all devices - from desktop to smartphones. With a focus on accessibility and adaptability, the interface automatically adjusts to various screen sizes, ensuring a clean, consistent, and user friendly design no matter where it's viewed.
  
**Figma**  
  
* This project was designed using Figma, a collaborative interface design tool. I utilized Figma to create the visual elements, layouts, and overall design of the project. It allowed easy to follow ideas and make changes quickly before exporting the final designs.
  
**Images**  

The images used in this project were first created and exported from **Figma** as **SVG** files to preserve quality and scalability.

To bring them into the project:

1. I selected the desired frame or element in Figma.  
2. In the right-hand panel, I opened the **Export** section.  
3. I selected **SVG** as the export format and saved the files locally.  
4. Then, using the **terminal**, I navigated to the appropriate project directory.  
5. I moved the exported SVG files from my local folders into the project using basic terminal commands like `mv` or `cp`.

All SVG files are located in the `images/` folder of this project.
